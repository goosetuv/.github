## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![Goosetuv Logo Full](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goosetuv/.github/main/logo_large.png)

I've been making tools and utilities to hopefully make Administration of Snow platforms a _little_ easier since **2018**.  Some cool companies are using these tools but I'm legally not allowed to tell you who, hope you understand. â™¥

## Useful things
These are probably the most useful things I've made. 

* [Snow Log Collector](https://github.com/goosetuv/Snow-Log-Collector/)
* [Snow Platform Monitor](https://github.com/goosetuv/Snow-Platform-Monitor)
* [Snow Update Checker](https://github.com/goosetuv/Snow-Update-Checker)
* [Snow Version API](https://snwapi.com)
* [Snow Inventory Password Reset](https://github.com/goosetuv/Snow-Inventory-Password-Reset)

I do have other tools but unfortunately, I had to private them (_for now..._).

## Fun facts

* I started working with Snow at a partner company as an apprentice
* I write some mangled code but it works â™¥
* I use these in my own job
